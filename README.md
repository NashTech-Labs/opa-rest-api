# opa-rest-api
The Open Policy Agent is an open source, general-purpose policy engine that unifies policy enforcement across the stack. OPA provides a high-level declarative language that letâ€™s you specify policy as code and simple APIs to offload policy decision-making from your software. You can use OPA to enforce policies in microservices, Kubernetes, CI/CD pipelines, API gateways, and more.
